# redandblue theme-skeleton
This is _the_ starter theme for creating a WordPress theme.

# Getting started
Install development dependencies by running `yarn`. After it completes, start Webpack with `yarn start`. Browsersync will open a new tab in your default browser. If not, the default address for it is `https://localhost:3000`. If you have something running on 3000, it will automatically try the next port, such as 3001.
